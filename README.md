# Grain_boundary_properties.
Scripts for charachterizing grain boundary properties at every mesh element of the grain boundary. 


1) These  scripts are meant to take scanning 3DXRD data as input and quantify microstructural properties.

2) Step 1 is data input, step 2 is grain segmentation.

3) Step 3 is surface mesh

4) Step 4 is curvature calculation.

5) Grain tracking script is useful for tracking different grains across two or more time steps using COM and misorientation. It also takes into account if you want the twins to be considered one grain or not.

6) quantify microstructure is a general purpose script, showing calculation of strain at every grain boundary mesh element   as a minimal example. In principle, every physical property  can be calculated at the grain boundary elements for further quantification.
